CodeBreaker is a classic game of logical deduction based on the classic Invicta game Mastermind. In CodeBreaker the player is trying to deduce a secret code comprised of colors. There are options for codes of 4, 5, or 6 colors from a pool of 6, 8, and 10 colors, and duplicates colors are allowed in the code. For each guess the player receives two clues: how many of the colors in the guess are the right color in the right spot, and how many are colors in the code but not in the right spot.

I've written this game on many platforms in many different languages and technologies over the decades, this being the latest incarnation. The code is by no means pretty or written with best-practices, it is simply written quickly in a couple of days as a labor of love for logical games. Enjoy!
