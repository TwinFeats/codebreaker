        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        In CodeBreaker you are trying to crack a secret code made up of colors. Every turn
        you submit a guess of from 4-6 colors (depending on the game size you are playing),
        chosen from a list of 6-10 colors (depending on the game size). For every color you
        have in the correct spot you will get a white counter, for every color you have that
        is in the code but not in the spot you have it you get a gray counter. Here is an
        example came with 4 colors in the code:
        <figure>
            <img src="images/codebreaker.png" />
            <figcaption>CodeBreaker</figcaption>
        </figure>
        For guess #1, the 0 in the white circle means there were no colors in the correct spot.
        The 1 in the gray circle means one of the colors in our guess is in the code but is not
        in the right spot. For guess #2 we got lucky and got 2 colors in the right spot, and 2
        in the wrong spot - so now we know all 4 colors in the code. Guess #3 got all 4 of the
        colors in the secret code correct!
        <p/>
        Notice how colors can repeat in the code - they could even all be the same color!
        <p/>
        Good luck, code breaker!
